# testunit_to_rspec
Convert Ruby test-unit files to rspec.

This is just something I use locally. It is far from perfect but works "well enough"
that I'm ok with it. But, not well enough for any sort of general release.

I understand that a "real" converter could be made, probably using an actual parser
and a lot more work, but it doesn't interest me. So, if you want to copy/borrow/use this
then please do so, but I'm not really interested in bug reports.
